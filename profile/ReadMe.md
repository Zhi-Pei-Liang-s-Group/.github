Our research is in the general area of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), signal processing, and machine learning (ML). Our goal has been to develop advanced data acquisition and processing methods to enable ultrafast and ultrahigh-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. Our work involves signal processing (e.g., sparse sampling theory, algorithms, subspace modeling, parameter estimation, machine learning, etc.), spin physics (magnetic resonance data acquisition design and implementation), and a bit quantum mechanics (simulation of spin dynamics to generate spectral basis), and biomedical applications (especially, brain mapping, i.e., mapping the structural, functional, and molecular fingerprints of brain function and diseases). Students interested in joining our group, please check out some of our publications to get a better understanding of our past and ongoing research.
